Micro2metadata
==============

Populating a simple library of scholarly article titles and their RSS feed URLs with bibliographic data, by giving it a structured schema in Javascript.

Made to decorate my partly structured HTML containing basics descriptors for each scholarly article with microdata, allowing it to be targeted with CSS, copied with Javascript and potentially then used to query PubMed for further details on individual articles.
